        Act as a certificate provider
      </h1>
      
      <p>You may be asked to be a certificate provider to help someone (the donor) when they’re making their lasting power of attorney (LPA).</p>

      <p>Providing a certificate for an LPA confirms that in your opinion, at the time of signing:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the donor understands the decisions they’ve made in the LPA and its purpose</li>
        <li>the donor has not been unduly pressured to make it</li>
        <li>there is no fraud involved in its creation</li>
        <li>there is no other reason it cannot be created</li>
      </ul>

      <p>As a certificate provider helping the donor register their LPA, you would need to:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>discuss the LPA with the donor</li>
        <li>witness the LPA</li>
        <li>prove your identity</li>
        <li>provide the certificate for the LPA</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you do not want to be a certificate provider</h2>

      <p>If you do not want to be someone's certificate provider, you can refuse the role. The donor can choose an alternative certificate provider up to the point they sign the LPA.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who can be a certificate provider</h2>

      <p>To be a certificate provider, you must be 18 or over and you must either:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>have known the donor personally for at least 2 years – for example, as a friend or neighbour (but not as a relative)</li>
        <li>be someone with the relevant professional skills and expertise to provide the certificate for an LPA – for example, a solicitor</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You cannot be:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>an attorney on the donor’s LPA or on any previous LPA or enduring power of attorney, even if it has now been revoked</li>
        <li>related to or in a relationship with the donor or any of their attorneys</li>
        <li>a business partner or employee of the donor or their attorneys</li>
        <li>working in a care home where the donor or one of their relatives lives</li>
        <li>a director or an employee of a trust corporation acting as one of the donor’s attorneys</li>
      </ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Discuss the LPA with the donor</h2>

<p>You’ll need to read the LPA and talk to the donor to check they understand it. You should discuss the LPA in private, without attorneys or other people present.</p>
<p>You should consider if they can: </p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>understand how the LPA works</li>
  <li>retain that information long enough to be able to make a decision</li>
  <li>weigh up the information available to make the decision</li>
  <li>communicate their decision, for example by talking, using sign language or movements like squeezing a hand</li>
</ul>

<p>If they seem unusually anxious or are acting differently to how they normally would, consider if they’re being unduly pressured into making the LPA.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If you have concerns about the LPA registration</h3>

<p>If you have concerns about the LPA, do not witness it or provide your certificate. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-the-public-guardian">Contact the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG)</a> instead.</p>

<p>You can also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/object-registration-power-attorney">object to the LPA</a>, which could prevent it from being registered.</p>


<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If you do not have concerns about the LPA registration</h3>

<p>If you do not have concerns about the LPA, you can complete your remaining tasks as a certficate provider.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Witness the LPA</h2>

<p>You’ll need to watch the donor sign the LPA. You must confirm you’ve witnessed their signature either:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>online, by entering a witness code OPG sends you</li>
        <li>on paper, by signing a paper form</li>
      </ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Prove your identity</h2>

<p>When you’ve witnessed the donor’s signature, OPG will contact you with guidance about next steps. You’ll need documents or information to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/using-your-gov-uk-one-login">prove your identity using GOV.UK One Login.</a> If you haven’t used GOV.UK One Login before, you’ll be asked to set up an account.</p>

<p>You'll also need your certificate provider access code, which OPG will send to you.</p>
   
<p>If your personal information is incorrect in the LPA, this may prevent it being registered. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-the-public-guardian">Contact OPG</a> to amend your details.</p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Provide a certificate online</h2>

<p>When you’ve successfully proved your identity, you’ll be guided through the process of providing your certificate online.</p>

  </svg>
</a>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Provide a certificate by post</h2>

<p>If you've received a letter from OPG about being a certificate provider, it should include a paper form. If not, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-the-public-guardian">contact OPG</a> and ask for a paper form to be sent to you.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">After you’ve completed your role as certificate provider for the LPA</h2>

<p>OPG will let the donor know when you have proved your identity and provided the certificate.</p>

<p>Your role in the process is complete.</p>
